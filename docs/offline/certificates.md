# Certificate Management Strategy

## 1. Offline PKI Model
Since we cannot reach public CAs (Let's Encrypt), we rely on a private trust model.

### Role: Root CA
- **Type:** Self-Signed Root Certificate (`CN=TechnoSupport-VMS-Root`).
- **Creation:** Generated by the Administrator during initial site provisioning (using OpenSSL or PowerShell helpers).
- **Private Key:** Stored offline (USB Drive) or heavily restricted (ACLs) on the server.

### Role: Server Certificate (Leaf)
- **Type:** TLS Web Server Authentication.
- **Signed By:** The Root CA.
- **Subject:** IP Address or Internal Hostname.

## 2. Trust Bootstrap
To prevent browser warnings on Operator workstations:
1. Export the **Root CA Public Certificate** (`.crt`).
2. Distribute to all Operator Workstations.
3. **Action:** Install into Windows/macOS **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** store.

## 3. Lifecycle Policy
- **Validity:**
    - Root CA: 10 Years.
    - Leaf Cert: 1 Year (Rotation required annually).
- **Revocation:** Manual CRL distribution (rarely used in simple offline sites; mostly reliance on short leaf lifespans).
